Software packages used 
1. PC loaded with vivado.
2. EdaPlayground Task 
1: Design a Finite State Machine for the Remote Control Key for Garage Door Lock (50 Marks) 
Draw a Mealy/Moore FSM state diagram for the given problem. Clearly show your design steps using state diagrams, 
state tables and state assign tables. Task 2: Verilog Code (25 Marks) Create a Verilog code for the FSM obtained in Task 1. 
Task 3: Test Bench and Simulation (25 Marks) Write a testbench for the Verilog design and simulate it using vivado or EdaPlayground. 
You must test the design for all important cases: 1. entry of correct key 2. entry of wrong key less than three times 3. 
entry of wrong key three times. Provide timing diagrams to prove that your design meets all the design criteria. 
Problem description: In this project, you are required to design a code detector for a garage door lock. 
The lock opens when the user enters an individual 5-digit code or key in his remote control. 
Your task is to design the code detector as a finite state machine that checks a specific 5-digit code.
The 5-digit key is equal to the five right-most digits of your student ID. So, if your ID is 100012345 
then the code detector must detect the pattern 12345. The design criteria are: 1. 
The key to the garage door is the last five digits of student ID. 2. The key digits should be represented as hexadecimal numbers.
3. If the user enters a wrong key three times successively, the lock must be blocked until it is reset. 
This reset takes the code detector to its start state.
